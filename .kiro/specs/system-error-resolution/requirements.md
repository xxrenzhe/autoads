# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the current TypeScript errors and system issues in the codebase. Analysis shows approximately 1000+ TypeScript errors across multiple areas including React Admin integration, URL parameter handling, component prop types, and external library compatibility issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React Admin integration errors to be resolved, so that the admin interface works correctly with proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing React Admin types THEN the system SHALL use the correct import names from the current version
2. WHEN using React Admin components THEN the system SHALL provide props that match the expected interfaces
3. WHEN implementing auth providers THEN the system SHALL use the correct parameter types for authentication methods
4. WHEN implementing data providers THEN the system SHALL handle pagination and sorting with proper type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all URL parameter and query handling errors to be fixed, so that API requests and navigation work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building URL search parameters THEN the system SHALL use proper URLSearchParams constructor arguments
2. WHEN handling query parameters THEN the system SHALL convert complex objects to valid query string formats
3. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL handle URL parameters with correct typing
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL construct URLs with proper parameter encoding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component prop type errors to be resolved, so that React components render correctly without type conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Material-UI components THEN the system SHALL provide props that match the component's expected interface
2. WHEN passing color props to components THEN the system SHALL use valid color values from the component's type definitions
3. WHEN handling component events THEN the system SHALL use proper event handler types
4. WHEN managing component state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state types and hooks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all external library compatibility issues to be fixed, so that third-party integrations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using React Admin library THEN the system SHALL be compatible with the installed version's API
2. WHEN using Material-UI components THEN the system SHALL use props and types that match the current version
3. WHEN integrating with authentication libraries THEN the system SHALL use correct method signatures and parameters
4. WHEN using utility libraries THEN the system SHALL handle version-specific API changes properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all property access and null safety errors to be resolved, so that the application runs without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the system SHALL check for property existence before access
2. WHEN handling potentially undefined values THEN the system SHALL use proper null checking and optional chaining
3. WHEN working with API responses THEN the system SHALL handle nullable fields safely
4. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL validate data before property access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to pass with zero errors, so that the application can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL complete with exit code 0 and zero errors
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL compile successfully without type errors
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL not show any TypeScript warnings
4. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL pass all type checking validations
