# Business Architecture Componentization and Modularization Requirements

## Introduction

This project aims to refactor the existing AutoAds automated marketing platform through comprehensive business architecture restructuring, implementing componentized and modularized design principles. The refactoring must ensure the stability of three core business functions (siterank, batchopen, adscenter) while building a modern, maintainable, and extensible business architecture with clear responsibilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Architecture Design Principles

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the refactored system to follow "high cohesion, low coupling" and "single responsibility" principles based on Clean Architecture, so that the system becomes more maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing new modules THEN the system SHALL ensure each module is responsible for only a single business domain
2. WHEN modules need to interact THEN the system SHALL communicate through clearly defined interfaces
3. WHEN evaluating module cohesion THEN the system SHALL ensure internal components work closely together toward the same business goal
4. WHEN analyzing module coupling THEN the system SHALL ensure minimal and explicit dependencies between modules
5. WHEN modifying a module THEN the system SHALL ensure no impact on other modules' normal operation

### Requirement 2: Core Business Stability Assurance

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to ensure the stability of siterank, batchopen, and adscenter core business functions during refactoring, so that existing users are not affected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring the siterank module THEN the system SHALL maintain the integrity and accuracy of website ranking analysis functionality
2. WHEN refactoring the batchopen module THEN the system SHALL maintain the performance and stability of batch URL opening functionality
3. WHEN refactoring the adscenter module THEN the system SHALL maintain the reliability of Google Ads automation management functionality
4. WHEN performing any refactoring operations THEN the system SHALL verify core functionality correctness through automated testing
5. WHEN deploying refactored code THEN the system SHALL support progressive deployment and quick rollback mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Modular Directory Structure

**User Story:** As a development engineer, I want each new module and component to have a standardized independent directory structure, so that I can quickly locate and maintain code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new business modules THEN the system SHALL create independent module directories under `src/modules/`
2. WHEN creating new shared components THEN the system SHALL create component directories under `src/shared/components/`
3. WHEN creating new business components THEN the system SHALL create them under the corresponding module's `components/` subdirectory
4. WHEN creating new services THEN the system SHALL create them under the corresponding module's `services/` subdirectory
5. WHEN creating new type definitions THEN the system SHALL create them under the corresponding module's `types/` subdirectory

### Requirement 4: Complete Documentation System

**User Story:** As a team member, I want each module and component to have detailed documentation including interface descriptions and dependency relationships, so that I can quickly understand and use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new modules THEN the system SHALL generate README.md files containing module overview, functionality description, and API interfaces
2. WHEN defining module interfaces THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc comments for detailed descriptions
3. WHEN modules have external dependencies THEN the system SHALL clearly list dependency relationships and version requirements in documentation
4. WHEN modules provide configuration options THEN the system SHALL detail configuration parameters and default values in documentation
5. WHEN modules have usage examples THEN the system SHALL provide complete code examples in documentation

### Requirement 5: Modern Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to build a business architecture based on modern technology stack that supports high availability, scalability, and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing module architecture THEN the system SHALL adopt Clean Architecture layered architecture pattern
2. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection and inversion of control principles
3. WHEN handling asynchronous operations THEN the system SHALL use modern Promise/async-await patterns
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use immutable data structures and state management patterns
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement unified error handling and logging mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Multi-user Management Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the system to support multi-user management with role-based access control, so that different users can access appropriate functionality based on their permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL authenticate users and establish secure sessions
2. WHEN users perform operations THEN the system SHALL verify permissions based on user roles
3. WHEN managing user data THEN the system SHALL implement tenant isolation to ensure data security
4. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL log access activities for audit purposes
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling for concurrent user access

### Requirement 7: React Admin Migration and Optimization

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the backend management system to migrate to React Admin with appropriate optimizations including state management, UI consistency, real-time data updates, and performance optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to React Admin THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing administrative functionality
2. WHEN managing application state THEN the system SHALL implement efficient state management with caching strategies
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL provide consistent UI components and user experience
4. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the interface in real-time without manual refresh
5. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination, filtering, and performance optimizations

### Requirement 8: High Concurrency and High Performance

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to handle high concurrent access and maintain high performance, so that multiple users can use core functions simultaneously without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
2. WHEN processing batch operations THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently using queue systems
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to reduce database load
4. WHEN traffic spikes occur THEN the system SHALL auto-scale resources to maintain performance
5. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics and alerting

### Requirement 9: Technical Implementation Accuracy

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to leverage Context7 MCP to obtain the latest technical documentation, ensuring technical implementation accuracy and stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting technical solutions THEN the system SHALL verify latest best practices through Context7 MCP
2. WHEN implementing architecture patterns THEN the system SHALL reference official Clean Architecture documentation and examples
3. WHEN using third-party libraries THEN the system SHALL obtain latest API documentation and usage guides through Context7 MCP
4. WHEN encountering technical issues THEN the system SHALL find authoritative solutions through Context7 MCP
5. WHEN conducting code reviews THEN the system SHALL validate implementation correctness against latest technical standards
