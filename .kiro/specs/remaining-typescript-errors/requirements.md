# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the remaining 535 TypeScript errors discovered in the codebase after the initial TypeScript error fixes project. These errors span across 80 files and include database model mismatches, missing service methods, type safety issues, and API route parameter problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database model property errors to be fixed, so that Prisma operations work correctly with the current schema.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing database model properties THEN the system SHALL use only properties that exist in the current Prisma schema
2. WHEN creating or updating database records THEN the system SHALL provide all required fields according to the schema
3. WHEN querying database relations THEN the system SHALL use correct relation names as defined in the schema
4. WHEN performing database aggregations THEN the system SHALL use valid scalar field enums for grouping and ordering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing service methods to be implemented, so that API routes and components can call the required functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes call service methods THEN the system SHALL have all referenced methods implemented
2. WHEN service methods are called with parameters THEN the system SHALL accept the correct number and types of parameters
3. WHEN service methods return data THEN the system SHALL return data in the expected format and type
4. WHEN service methods handle errors THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and logging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type safety issues to be resolved, so that the application has proper type checking and runtime safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling nullable values THEN the system SHALL perform proper null checks before accessing properties
2. WHEN converting between types THEN the system SHALL use safe type conversion utilities
3. WHEN working with union types THEN the system SHALL use proper type guards and narrowing
4. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the system SHALL ensure properties exist before access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API route parameter and response type errors to be fixed, so that API endpoints work correctly with proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes receive requests THEN the system SHALL properly type request parameters and body data
2. WHEN API routes return responses THEN the system SHALL return properly typed response objects
3. WHEN API routes handle authentication THEN the system SHALL use correct authentication context types
4. WHEN API routes perform validation THEN the system SHALL validate input data against proper schemas

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component and UI type errors to be resolved, so that React components render correctly with proper prop types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components receive props THEN the system SHALL validate props against defined interfaces
2. WHEN components handle events THEN the system SHALL use proper event handler types
3. WHEN components manage state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state types and hooks
4. WHEN components render conditionally THEN the system SHALL handle all possible state combinations safely

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all external library integration errors to be fixed, so that third-party services work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with Stripe API THEN the system SHALL use correct Stripe SDK types and methods
2. WHEN integrating with Google APIs THEN the system SHALL use proper OAuth2 client methods and parameters
3. WHEN integrating with Redis THEN the system SHALL use valid Redis configuration options
4. WHEN integrating with external APIs THEN the system SHALL handle API responses with correct typing
