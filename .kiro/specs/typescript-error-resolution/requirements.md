# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the systematic resolution of TypeScript compilation errors in the codebase. The errors span multiple categories including missing Prisma client imports, implicit any types, unknown type handling, and various type safety issues. The goal is to fix all TypeScript errors while maintaining code functionality and improving type safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Prisma client imports to work correctly, so that database operations function properly without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN all PrismaClient imports SHALL resolve successfully
2. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN all UserRole imports from Prisma SHALL resolve successfully
3. IF Prisma client is not properly generated THEN the system SHALL regenerate the client automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function parameters to have explicit types, so that the code is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN no parameters SHALL have implicit 'any' types
2. WHEN callback functions are used THEN all parameters SHALL have explicit type annotations
3. WHEN array methods like map, reduce, filter are used THEN callback parameters SHALL be properly typed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unknown types to be properly handled, so that type safety is maintained throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is of type 'unknown' THEN it SHALL be properly type-guarded before use
2. WHEN accessing properties on unknown types THEN proper type assertions or guards SHALL be used
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN unknown data SHALL be validated before property access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Zod error handling to work correctly, so that validation errors are properly processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ZodError occurs THEN the 'errors' property SHALL be accessible
2. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL be properly extracted and formatted
3. WHEN using Zod validation THEN proper error types SHALL be used

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service method calls to use correct parameter types, so that the application functions without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling service methods THEN all parameters SHALL match expected types
2. WHEN using enum values THEN they SHALL be properly typed and converted if necessary
3. WHEN accessing object properties THEN they SHALL exist on the type definition

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all array operations to maintain type safety, so that data transformations are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using array methods THEN return types SHALL be properly defined
2. WHEN mapping arrays THEN the transformation function SHALL have correct input/output types
3. WHEN reducing arrays THEN accumulator and item types SHALL be explicit

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all integration service calls to have correct parameter counts and types, so that external API integrations work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling integration service methods THEN argument counts SHALL match method signatures
2. WHEN passing parameters to service methods THEN types SHALL be compatible with expected parameters
3. WHEN handling integration responses THEN return types SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all object property access to be type-safe, so that runtime errors are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing object properties THEN properties SHALL exist on the type definition
2. WHEN using enum values as object keys THEN proper type mapping SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN assigning values to typed variables THEN types SHALL be compatible

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service status values to match expected types, so that monitoring and health checks work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting service status values THEN they SHALL match the expected union type
2. WHEN returning status objects THEN all properties SHALL have correct types
3. WHEN processing status arrays THEN element types SHALL be consistent
