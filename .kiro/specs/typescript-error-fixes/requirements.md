# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive fixing of all TypeScript errors found in the `npm run type-check` command. The project currently has 657 TypeScript errors across 111 files that need to be systematically resolved to ensure type safety, code quality, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors to be fixed, so that the codebase maintains type safety and can be built without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN TypeScript errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality
3. WHEN fixing type errors THEN the system SHALL preserve the original business logic
4. WHEN type fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript types instead of `any` where possible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database schema-related type errors to be resolved, so that Prisma client operations work correctly with proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Prisma client operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use correct database schema types
2. WHEN creating database records THEN the system SHALL only include valid properties for each model
3. WHEN querying database records THEN the system SHALL use correct select and include options
4. WHEN handling JSON fields THEN the system SHALL properly handle nullable JSON values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service layer type errors to be fixed, so that all service methods have proper type definitions and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods are called THEN the system SHALL have proper parameter and return types
2. WHEN handling null/undefined values THEN the system SHALL use proper null checking and type guards
3. WHEN working with external APIs THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for responses
4. WHEN using crypto operations THEN the system SHALL use correct Node.js crypto API methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API route type errors to be resolved, so that all API endpoints have proper request/response typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes handle requests THEN the system SHALL have proper typing for request parameters
2. WHEN API routes return responses THEN the system SHALL have consistent response type structures
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use proper user session types
4. WHEN processing form data THEN the system SHALL validate and type input data correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component type errors to be fixed, so that React components have proper prop types and state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components receive props THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN components use hooks THEN the system SHALL have correct hook typing
3. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL use proper event handler types
4. WHEN managing component state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want middleware and utility type errors to be resolved, so that cross-cutting concerns have proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN middleware processes requests THEN the system SHALL have proper request/response typing
2. WHEN utility functions are used THEN the system SHALL have correct parameter and return types
3. WHEN handling configuration THEN the system SHALL use proper environment variable types
4. WHEN working with third-party libraries THEN the system SHALL have correct type definitions
