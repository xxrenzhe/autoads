		Title: `Invalid first argument to \'exec.Command\'`,
		Text: `\'os/exec\' runs programs directly (using variants of the fork and exec
system calls on Unix systems). This shouldn't be confused with running
a command in a shell. The shell will allow for features such as input
redirection, pipes, and general scripting. The shell is also
responsible for splitting the user's input into a program name and its
arguments. For example, the equivalent to

    ls / /tmp

would be

    exec.Command("ls", "/", "/tmp")

If you want to run a command in a shell, consider using something like
the following â€“ but be aware that not all systems, particularly
Windows, will have a \'/bin/sh\' program:

    exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", "ls | grep Awesome")`,
		Since:    "2017.1",
		Severity: lint.SeverityWarning,
		MergeIf:  lint.MergeIfAny,
	},

			continue

			continue

			"first argument to exec.Command looks like a shell command, but a program name or path are expected")
