# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive logging system that captures all application logs, stores them persistently with rotation, and provides a real-time web interface for log viewing and analysis. The system focuses on simplicity, stability, and practical utility without over-engineering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application logs to be saved to files in addition to stdout output, so that I can review historical logs even after the application restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application outputs a log message THEN the system SHALL write the same message to both stdout and a log file
2. WHEN writing to log files THEN the system SHALL maintain the same log format and timestamp as stdout
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create log files in a dedicated logs directory
4. IF a log write operation fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want log files to be automatically rotated and old logs cleaned up, so that disk space usage remains controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a log file reaches a maximum size limit THEN the system SHALL create a new log file and archive the current one
2. WHEN log files are rotated THEN the system SHALL keep a maximum of 7 days worth of log files
3. WHEN the retention period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically delete log files older than 7 days
4. WHEN rotating logs THEN the system SHALL use timestamp-based naming for archived files
5. IF disk space is critically low THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping the most recent logs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access real-time logs through the web interface, so that I can monitor application behavior without accessing the server directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on "更多" in the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL show a dropdown menu
2. WHEN I click on "实时日志" in the dropdown THEN the system SHALL navigate to the log viewing page
3. WHEN I access the log viewing page THEN the system SHALL display it at a dedicated route
4. WHEN the navigation is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain existing navigation functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view real-time logs in the web interface, so that I can monitor current application activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the log viewing page THEN the system SHALL display the most recent log entries
2. WHEN new log entries are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically update the display in real-time
3. WHEN viewing real-time logs THEN the system SHALL auto-scroll to show the latest entries
4. WHEN there are many log entries THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for performance
5. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search and filter historical logs, so that I can troubleshoot issues that occurred in the past.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the log viewing page THEN the system SHALL provide options to view historical log files
2. WHEN I select a historical log file THEN the system SHALL load and display its contents
3. WHEN I enter search terms THEN the system SHALL filter log entries matching the criteria
4. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL support filtering by log level, timestamp range, and text content
5. WHEN loading large log files THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see log statistics and trends, so that I can understand application behavior patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the log viewing page THEN the system SHALL display a chart showing log entry counts over time
2. WHEN viewing log statistics THEN the system SHALL show counts by log level (error, warn, info, debug)
3. WHEN the time period changes THEN the system SHALL update the statistics chart accordingly
4. WHEN there are no logs for a time period THEN the system SHALL display zero counts appropriately
5. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL provide options for different time ranges (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logging system to be performant and not impact application speed, so that logging doesn't become a bottleneck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing logs THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous I/O operations
2. WHEN the log buffer is full THEN the system SHALL handle backpressure gracefully
3. WHEN serving log data to the web interface THEN the system SHALL implement efficient streaming
4. WHEN multiple users access logs simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain good performance
5. IF log operations become slow THEN the system SHALL not block the main application thread

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logging system to be reliable and stable, so that it doesn't cause application crashes or data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file system errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
2. WHEN log files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL continue operating and create new files
3. WHEN the system runs out of disk space THEN the system SHALL handle the error and continue logging to stdout
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL flush all pending log writes
5. IF the logging system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log these errors to a separate error log
