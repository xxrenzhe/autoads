# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical TypeScript compilation errors preventing the application from building successfully. The errors span multiple categories including missing Prisma client exports, implicit 'any' type parameters, and type compatibility issues. The goal is to resolve all TypeScript errors while maintaining code functionality and type safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Prisma client to export all necessary types and models, so that I can use them throughout the application without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing PrismaClient from "@prisma/client" THEN the import SHALL succeed without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN importing UserRole, UserStatus, ServiceAlert, ApiAccessLog, ApiPerformanceLog, Alert, and SystemConfig from "@prisma/client" THEN all imports SHALL be available and properly typed
3. WHEN the Prisma schema is regenerated THEN all required types SHALL be exported from the client

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function parameters to have explicit types, so that the code passes TypeScript strict mode compilation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles the codebase THEN no parameters SHALL have implicit 'any' types
2. WHEN callback functions are used in array methods THEN all parameters SHALL have explicit type annotations
3. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN all event parameters SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want array method type compatibility issues resolved, so that reduce operations work correctly with proper typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Array.reduce() methods THEN the accumulator and current value types SHALL be properly defined
2. WHEN chaining array operations THEN type inference SHALL work correctly throughout the chain
3. WHEN performing aggregation operations THEN the return types SHALL match the expected types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want index access operations to be type-safe, so that object property access doesn't cause TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing object properties with dynamic keys THEN the access SHALL be type-safe
2. WHEN using enum values as object keys THEN TypeScript SHALL recognize the valid key types
3. WHEN performing object lookups THEN the return types SHALL be properly inferred

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire codebase to compile successfully, so that the application can be built and deployed without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the command SHALL complete with exit code 0
2. WHEN building the application THEN no TypeScript compilation errors SHALL occur
3. WHEN all fixes are applied THEN the application functionality SHALL remain unchanged
