# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the remaining TypeScript errors in the codebase. The errors include Prisma client import issues, implicit `any` type parameters, and missing type definitions that are preventing successful compilation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Prisma client import errors to be resolved, so that database operations work correctly with proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing PrismaClient THEN the system SHALL successfully import from the correct Prisma client package
2. WHEN importing UserRole enum THEN the system SHALL import from the correct Prisma client location
3. WHEN using Prisma client types THEN the system SHALL have access to all generated types
4. WHEN running type checking THEN the system SHALL not show any Prisma import errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all implicit `any` type parameters to be explicitly typed, so that the codebase maintains strict type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN function parameters are used THEN the system SHALL have explicit type annotations
2. WHEN callback functions receive parameters THEN the system SHALL type all parameters explicitly
3. WHEN array methods use callback functions THEN the system SHALL provide proper parameter types
4. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL type all response parameters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API route parameter types to be properly defined, so that request handling is type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes receive request parameters THEN the system SHALL type all parameters explicitly
2. WHEN processing request bodies THEN the system SHALL validate and type all input data
3. WHEN handling route responses THEN the system SHALL return properly typed response objects
4. WHEN using middleware functions THEN the system SHALL type all middleware parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service method parameters to be properly typed, so that service layer operations are type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods receive parameters THEN the system SHALL type all parameters explicitly
2. WHEN service methods process data THEN the system SHALL use proper type guards and validation
3. WHEN service methods return data THEN the system SHALL return properly typed results
4. WHEN service methods handle errors THEN the system SHALL use typed error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript compilation to pass with zero errors, so that the application can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL complete with exit code 0
2. WHEN TypeScript compiler runs THEN the system SHALL show zero type errors
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL compile successfully
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL not show any type warnings
