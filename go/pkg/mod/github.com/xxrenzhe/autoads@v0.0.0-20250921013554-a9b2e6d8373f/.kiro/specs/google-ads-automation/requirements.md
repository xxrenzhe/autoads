# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Google Ads automation system that manages promotional link tracking and automatic campaign updates. The system will use fingerprint browsers (AdsPower) to track original promotional links, extract final destination URLs, and automatically update Google Ads campaigns with the correct tracking parameters. The system will be implemented as a browser extension with a modern web interface for configuration management.
