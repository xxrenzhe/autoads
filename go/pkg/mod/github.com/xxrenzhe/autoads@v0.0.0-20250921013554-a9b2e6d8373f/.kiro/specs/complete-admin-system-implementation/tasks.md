- **Follow Established Patterns**: Use existing data provider, authentication, and routing patterns
- **Maintain Consistency**: Follow existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure
- **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure all existing features continue to work without regression

### 2. Database and API Integration
- **No Schema Changes**: All required database models already exist
- **Use Existing APIs**: Leverage existing 25+ admin API endpoints
- **Extend Where Needed**: Add new API endpoints only when existing ones are insufficient
- **Maintain Performance**: Use existing caching, indexing, and optimization strategies

### 3. Security and Authentication
- **Use Existing Auth**: Leverage established NextAuth and role-based access control
- **Maintain Security**: Follow existing security patterns and validation
- **Audit Logging**: Use existing audit logging for all admin actions
- **Input Validation**: Follow established validation patterns

### 4. Testing and Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for all new components and services
- **Integration Tests**: Test API integrations and data flows
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality is not broken
- **Performance Tests**: Maintain or improve existing performance metrics

### 5. Deployment Strategy
- **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy in phases to minimize risk
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system health and performance during deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback procedures for each phase

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Component Development
- **React-Admin Patterns**: Follow existing list, edit, create, show component patterns
- **Material-UI Components**: Use existing theme and component library
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing and interface definitions
- **Error Handling**: Use established error boundary and handling patterns

### API Development
- **RESTful Design**: Follow existing API design patterns
