# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses Redis connection instability issues observed in the AutoAds application during silent batch processing tasks. The logs show frequent Redis connection failures, reconnection attempts, and timeouts that disrupt proxy acquisition and caching operations. The goal is to implement a robust Redis connection management system that ensures stable, reliable Redis connectivity with proper error handling, connection pooling, and failover mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Connection Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive Redis connection monitoring, so that I can detect and diagnose connection issues before they impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Redis connection is established THEN the system SHALL validate the connection using PING commands
2. WHEN the connection validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including response times and error codes
3. WHEN the connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL track connection success/failure rates over time
4. IF the connection failure rate exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and initiate recovery procedures

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Reconnection Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intelligent reconnection strategy that adapts to network conditions, so that the application can recover from temporary network issues without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter
2. WHEN the connection fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL increase the backoff interval progressively
3. WHEN the connection succeeds after failure THEN the system SHALL gradually reduce the backoff interval
4. IF the maximum retry count is reached THEN the system SHALL enter degraded mode with appropriate logging

### Requirement 3: Connection Pool Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized connection pooling, so that the application can efficiently manage Redis connections under high load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a connection pool with configurable size
2. WHEN connection demand increases THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust pool size within limits
3. WHEN connections are idle THEN the system SHALL clean up unused connections
4. IF the pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 4: Graceful Degradation and Fallback

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue functioning even when Redis is unavailable, so that my batch processing tasks can complete with minimal disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL switch to in-memory caching automatically
2. WHEN Redis connection is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize cached data back to Redis
3. WHEN operating in degraded mode THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality with appropriate performance
4. IF Redis is unavailable for extended periods THEN the system SHALL preserve data integrity and provide status updates

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized Redis configuration management, so that I can easily adjust connection parameters for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load Redis configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN configuration changes are detected THEN the system SHALL validate and apply changes without restart
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL log specific validation errors
4. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL use safe default values

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want detailed Redis performance metrics, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize connection performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations are performed THEN the system SHALL collect response time metrics
2. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL track error rates and patterns
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports
4. IF metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger optimization procedures

### Requirement 7: Security and Connection Validation

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want secure Redis connections with proper validation, so that sensitive data is protected and connections are authenticated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing Redis connections THEN the system SHALL use TLS encryption when configured
2. WHEN connection authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing credentials
3. WHEN connection parameters change THEN the system SHALL re-validate security settings
4. IF security validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent connection attempts

### Requirement 8: Logging and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging tools, so that I can troubleshoot Redis connection issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed operation traces
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log stack traces and context information
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose connection state information
4. IF logs are generated THEN the system SHALL structure them for easy parsing and analysis
